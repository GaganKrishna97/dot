# Book Library API

A simple Book Library API built with FastAPI.  
This API allows you to create, read, update, and delete books stored in an in-memory database (a Python list).  
Itâ€™s organized with a clean structure separating models, CRUD operations, API routes, and the main app launcher.

---

## Project Structure

/app
main.py # Entry point, starts the FastAPI app using Uvicorn
mod.py # Book model definition using Pydantic
database.py # In-memory list to simulate a database
crud.py # Functions to create, read, update, and delete books
api.py # FastAPI app instance with all route handlers


---

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

2. Install dependencies:

pip install fastapi uvicorn


---

## How to Run

Run the app by executing:

python main.py


The server will start at:  
http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Testing the API

Visit the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI at:  
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  

You can test all the endpoints easily using this interface.

## Notes

- This project uses an in-memory data store (a Python list), so data will be lost when the app stops.
- For production, replace the in-memory store with a real database.
- You can extend this API by adding authentication, validation, error handling, and persistent storage.
